Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning
Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to predict breast cancer diagnosis (benign or malignant) using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. The model uses Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) data to assist in early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer.
Features

Binary classification of breast cancer (benign/malignant)
Uses Logistic Regression algorithm
Built with scikit-learn machine learning library
Includes data visualization and analysis
Performance metrics evaluation

Dependencies

Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn

Dataset
The project uses the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset from scikit-learn, which includes features computed from digitized images of FNA of breast mass. Features include:

Radius
Texture
Perimeter
Area
Smoothness
And other cellular characteristics

Model

Algorithm: Logistic Regression
Data split: Training (80%) and Testing (20%)
Evaluation metrics: Accuracy Score

Future Improvements

Implement additional machine learning algorithms for comparison
Add cross-validation
Include feature importance analysis
Create a web interface for predictions
